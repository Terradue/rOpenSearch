# Building and installing the development version

The rOpenSearch package is built using maven.

From a terminal: 

```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:Terradue/rOpenSearch.git
cd rOpenSearch
mvn compile
```

That generates a compressed archive with the rOpenSearch package in:

```
~/rOpenSearch/target/R/src/rOpenSearch_x.y.z.tar.gz
```
To install the package, start an R session and run:

```coffee
install.packages("~/rOpenSearch/target/R/src/rOpenSearch_x.y.z.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

> Note x.y.z is the development version number.

Then load the library:

```coffee
library(rOpenSearch)
```
